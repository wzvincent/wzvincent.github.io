# Overview
![](ember-core-concepts.png)
### Router
When *url* is changed, the first thing that happens is that the Ember **router maps the URL to a route handler**.
The route handler then typically does two things:

* It renders a template.
* It loads a **model** that is then available to the **template**.
### Model
Models represent persistent state.
### Hooks
In Ember, we use the term *hook* for methods that are **automatically called within the Ember application**. These are methods that can be expected to be called automatically, rather than having to call them specifically.

In the following example, the **didRender()** component lifecycle hook is used to log "I rendered!" to the console after each time the component is rendered.

```
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  didRender() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    console.log('I rendered!');
  }
});
```
